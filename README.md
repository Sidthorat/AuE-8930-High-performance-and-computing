# AuE-8930-High-performance-and-computing

##INSTRUCTOR:
Dr. Bing Li

Assistant Professor

COURSE DESCRIPTION:

Intelligent ADAS (advanced driver-assistance systems) and autonomous vehicles are running by advanced softwares, from hardware drivers, operating systems, middleware platforms, machine intelligence, high-level tasks, to human-machine interface. Efficient and robust computing are becoming more and more critical for the functionality and safety of the system, and different levels of simulation are also essential solutions for software or whole system verification under various environments. In addition, the software design of autonomous mobile robots and vehicles requires an effective autonomy for modularized and robust software system design with simulation integration for verification.

This course is designed to provide knowledge in the design and implementation of CPU/GPU computing, AI computing and simulation technologies for autonomous robots or vehicles software systems. Through extensive examples, case and paper studies, and project design, the students can obtain hands-on computing, high-performance computing (HPC), deep learning computing, and simulation skills to allow them to build software modules, and verification systems for ADAS or autonomous robots or vehicles.

##COURSE OBJECTIVES:

Learn to design and implement computing design solutions to computationally intensive problems for autonomy system modeling and simulation.
Develop computational thinking, programming and parallel programming skills.
Achieve performance and scalability through the understanding of hardware architecture and software mapping.
Achieve significant hands-on parallel/HPC/AI computing and programming experience.
Develop real applications on real hardware with CPU and GPUs.
Apply HPC to vehicle perception, deep learning, autonomy applications.
Learn HPC computing platforms skills on Linux/Ubuntu/Shell and Palmetto Cluster cloud computing, e.g. using Python Jupyter Notebook.
Learn to use autonomous driving simulators
ADAS/Auto-Simulation tools: Siemens PreScan, LGSVL, CARLA, Chrono, etc
PRE-REQUISITES
The universal programming language you can use for this course is Python (or other object-oriented programming languages which you prefer). C++ programming is not compulsory for course assignments, but if you use it if you’d like.
Even if you only have Matlab programming experience rather than Python/C++, you are fine to enroll in this course, but you will need to learn Python. This course will share related resources and have step-by-step homework design so that you can build/improve your programming skills through hands-on.
The content of this course will be self-contained, covering necessary fundamentals and prerequisites. This course will also direct related resources for Linux system usage.
